**These scripts were created for processing of post-alignment/count RNA-Seq data sets obtained from DAT;NuTRAP and VGAT;NuTRAP mice.

**These scripts were used to produce the results associated with the publication:  Parallel gene expression changes in ventral midbrain dopamine and GABA neurons during normal aging by Drumond-Bock et al., 2005.
